# Synthetic_St_Louis
This project received high marks for Econ 488 Winter 2022. It leverages synthetic control statistical learning with econometric analysis to develop a causal effect of the move of a national team on local crime. 

Abstract: 
We develop a synthetic control that models a fictional St Louis 
in which the Rams, formally the NFL team for St Louis, never
relocated to Los Angeles, as occurred in 2016. Using crime data
From the FBI UCR Program and other demographic information 
we modeled an effective synthetic St Louis and found a significant 
decrease in crime in the years following the relocation.
