# Synthetic_St_Louis
The project I completed for ECON 488 Winter 2022 utlizing the synthetic control method

Abstract: 
We develop a synthetic control that models a fictional St Louis 
in which the Rams, formally the NFL team for St Louis, never
relocated to Los Angeles, as occurred in 2016. Using crime data
From the FBI UCR Program and other demographic information 
we modeled an effective synthetic St Louis and found a significant 
decrease in crime in the years following the relocation.
